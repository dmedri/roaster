Check R updates and build sources

## Introduction

add new admin utilities.

Since the early bash prototypes there are some notable features:

* get the latest R stable release;
* show informations about local installation (standard);
* get an updated MIRRORS list;
* build R for your system (build-standard)
* create a virtual environment (build-virtualenv)

## Guide / Help
