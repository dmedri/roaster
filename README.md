## Introduction

This project is an attempt to design an easy tool to support 
[**R**](http://www.r-project.org), helps its users (**statisticians** and **data
scientists**) and technicians (**sysadmins** and **devops**). It's an independent
project, unlinked to the R Foundation.

Most common use-cases:

* get the source code for a stable/unstable R release;
* install all the needed tools and libraries needed for the build;
* build the source code three with different options;
* update and deploy the R environment.

Everything rely upon the Bash shell and could run on almost all modern GNU/Linux 
distributions. It's the main focus. By the way, there're open tickets to support 
Windows, MacOs and other Unix-like Oses.
