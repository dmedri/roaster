# R SERVER INSTALLATION

At build time, the source tree was copied under the
directory ./src with the same 'configure' options.

 $ cd /opt/src/<your-directory>/src/

SVN RBTYPE ("branch", "trunk") can receive updates:

 $ svn up

All RBTYPE ("stable", "branch", "trunk") can be re-builded:

 $ make
 $ make check
 $ sudo make install
 $ make clean

To run:

 $ export PATH=/opt/R/<your-directory>/bin:$PATH
 $ R
